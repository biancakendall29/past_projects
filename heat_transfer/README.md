# Heat Transfer
## Background
This project, titled *Electric motor heat dissipation during high-speed drone flight*, was done by myself, Bianca Kendall, for a fourth year module during my BEng (mechanical) degree called Heat Transfer A414. The coding aspect of the project entailed designing numerical methods (using MATLAB) to calculate and map the temperature distrubution through a motor in a drone during a 30-minute flight.

    
## Files
The files provided demonstrate the same code but in different formats. The **MATLAB_code.pdf** file is readable without the MATLAB application and contains the source code as well as the results of running the code. The code itself can be run in MATLAB using either the script file **HT414.m** or the livescript file **HT414.mlx**.

The **HT414_fullProject** is given as a reference for the full scope of the project, containing the mathematics and heat transfer theory behind the project, but is not relevant to a software engineering/development context.
